# First, we need to extend our type system
types:
  # We can create a type alias for convenience and simple type replacement:
  # if we decide that id must be 32-bit integer we just need to make change in
  # one place here
  id: !core!u16

  # Defining a type as an "extension"of  (actually, constraint on) an existing type
  second_auth_factor: !core!u32
    max: 999999

  # Defining a type as a struct of existing types with field names
  key:
    - id: !id
    - xpubkey: !wallet!xpubkey
    - path: !wallet!derivation_path
    - fingerprint: !wallet!key_fingerprint

# Version is critical: it defines whether two parties connected through this
# API are compliant. It follows `features` BOLT-9 standard and defines which
# messages and TLV extensions are covered with each feature bit
version:
  - features: 5 # This version defines that a fifth bit is set

    messages:
      # Each message starts with ref id, representing type name, and
      # corresponding message_type u64 value
      # It may be empty, meaning that message has no data ...
      &ok 1:

      # .. or it may contain a set of fields organized in array
      &error 0:
        # Each field has it's name and type. The type is either
        # reference to an imported type name
        - errtype: !core!u16
        # which may contain additional parameters, like maximum allowed length
        # for UTF-8 strings (this parameters are parts of the type definition)
        - info: !strict!utf8
            max: 256

      &keys 1000:

      &keylist 2000:
        # A strict-encoded array (meaning that the number of items is represented
        # by u64 number and not by VarInt item) specifying particular type
        # of the data and limiting maximum number of items further than native
        # u16-bit limitation
